1. substitute puts with logger + debug / verbose mode generally
2. Using Data Class to classify JSON response dynamically. Upside: immutable, better performance (maybe?), less work. However it may be best for objects to be explicitiy defined. Can punt this for now. Ideally CoinBase has a standardized API manifest that can be pulled so objects can be autogenerated.
3. separate JWT logic as mixin / concern?
